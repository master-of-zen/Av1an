# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version will be supported with security updates. We will not maintain old branches.
For this reason, you should attempt to always use the latest released version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To privately report a vulnerability in Av1an, please visit [our advisories page](https://github.com/rust-av/Av1an/security/advisories) and use the button to report a vulnerability.
We will review it as soon as possible.

For vulnerabilities in dependencies, please open a pull request updating the dependency to a patched version.
